## How this repo works
- index.html contains a 1-second meta refresh redirect to the live Wix site.
- README.md documents structure and updates.
- Optional folders you can add:
  - ./media ‚Äî logos, PDFs (e.g., syllabus)
  - ./content ‚Äî exported data (CSV) if you use Wix Content Manager
  - ./custom-code ‚Äî any header/body snippets (if added later)

## Update playbook
1) Update the Wix site.  
2) Export new screenshots to ./screenshots.  
3) Commit to main with a message like ‚Äúdocs: add curriculum overview shot.‚Äù  
4) GitHub Pages keeps serving the redirect automatically.

## FAQ
- Why do we keep a GitHub repo for a Wix site?  
  For versioned screenshots, assets, quick QR sharing, and a stable Pages URL that forwards to Wix.

- Can we host the full site here?  
  Wix doesn‚Äôt export the full visual layout. The redirect keeps the repo lightweight and current.

## Changelog
- 2025-09-29: Initial README + Pages redirect scaffold.
